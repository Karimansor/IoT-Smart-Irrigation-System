## Overview

A smart irrigation system using NodeMCU ESP8266 that automates watering based on soil moisture and allows remote control via Blynk.

## Features

- Real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity monitoring  
- Auto irrigation below 30% moisture  
- Manual control via Blynk  
- Notifications on irrigation events  
- Blynk dashboard for data and control

## Components

- NodeMCU ESP8266  
- Soil moisture sensor  
- DHT11 sensor  
- Relay module  
- Water pump

## Problem & Objectives

Traditional irrigation methods waste water and lack accuracy. This project aims to:

- Automate irrigation using sensor data  
- Enable remote manual control  
- Display real-time data  
- Notify users of activity  
- Offer a cost-effective, scalable solution
