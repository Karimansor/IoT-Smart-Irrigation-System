# Smart Irrigation System

## Overview

This project implements a smart irrigation system using a NodeMCU ESP8266, designed to optimize water usage and improve plant health. It monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time, and can automatically or manually control irrigation via the Blynk IoT platform.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity  
- Automatic irrigation when moisture drops below 30%  
- Remote manual pump control via Blynk  
- Notifications on irrigation events (auto/manual)  
- Blynk dashboard for data visualization and control

## Hardware Used

- NodeMCU ESP8266  
- Soil moisture sensor  
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor  
- Relay module  
- Water pump

## Problem Statement

Conventional irrigation systems often waste water and fail to meet plant needs. This system addresses the inefficiency by using real-time sensor data to make irrigation decisions and offering users remote access and control.

## Objectives

- Automate irrigation based on soil moisture  
- Enable remote manual control via Blynk  
- Provide real-time sensor data  
- Notify users of irrigation activity  
- Offer a scalable, low-cost solution
